abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) printing offers the advantages of customisation, reproducibility and rapid production. In parallel, there is a demand for electrochemical components designed for miniaturisation or customisation of devices. Herein we report a straightforward, fast and simple method to prepare an Ag/AgCl pseudo-reference electrode primarily based on 3D printing using a graphene/polylactic acid filament. The fabrication process involves electrodeposition of silver followed by bleaching to form AgCl on the surface of the electrode. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm the fabrication process. Open circuit potential measurements against commercial Ag/AgCl reference electrodes reveal a difference of 14 ± 0.3 mV. Nonetheless, the values are stable and reproducible, fulfilling the necessary requirements of a reference electrode. The performance of the 3D-printed pseudo-reference electrode was tested via cyclic voltammetry in two redox systems, [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− and [Ru(NH3)6]2+/3+. Fabrication of stable 3D-printed reference electrodes represents a key step in the production of fully 3D-printable electrochemical systems.},

abstract = {Objective: To test the applicability of different types of commercially available electrodes and electrode gels or pastes for recording of slow EEG potentials. Methods: Experiments were carried out on six types of reusable electrodes (silver, tin and gold cup electrodes, sintered silver-silver chloride (Ag|AgCl), platinum, stainless steel), six disposable Ag|AgCl electrode models, and nine gels or pastes. We studied the parameters, which are critical in slow-potential recording, such as polarization, initial and long-term stability and low-frequency noise. Results: The best results were obtained with the reusable sintered Ag|AgCl electrodes. The six disposable Ag|AgCl electrode models also proved to have appropriate electrical properties. Other types of reusable electrodes suffered from diverse degrees of polarization, baseline drift, low-frequency noise, high resistance, and changes in properties due to wear and tear. Seven out of nine gels or pastes contained a significant amount of chloride, which is a prerequisite for DC stability of Ag|AgCl electrodes, whereas the absolute concentration of chloride had little effect. Conclusions: Direct current (DC) coupled recording of EEG is critically dependent on the choice of electrode and gel. Significance: Our results provide rigorous criteria for choosing DC-stable electrodes and gels for DC-coupled or long time-constant AC-coupled recordings of slow EEG potentials. {\textcopyright} 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

abstract = {Users of battery powered equipment expect safeguards to prevent damage to the internalelectronics in the event of reverse battery installation, accidental short circuiting, or otherinappropriate operation. These safeguards can be either mechanical or electronic. Anexample of a mechanical safeguard is requiring the use of special connectors andinstructional pictures and symbols. For example, a 9-V battery has different terminals, andits rechargeable battery packs are physically designed for one direction of insertion. Otherbattery types, like single-cell alkaline, are not so easily protected by mechanical safeguards.Therefore, battery powered equipment designers and manufacturers must ensure that anyreverse current flow and reverse bias voltage is low enough to prevent damage to either thebattery itself or the equipment's internal electronics. To provide these electronic safeguards,manufacturers typically chose either a diode or transistor for reverse battery protection.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE. Significant research has been conducted in recent years to design low-cost alternatives to the current EEG monitoring systems used in healthcare facilities. Testing such systems on a vulnerable population such as newborns is complicated due to ethical and regulatory considerations that slow down the technical development. This paper presents and validates a method for quantifying the accuracy of neonatal EEG acquisition systems and electrode technologies via clinical data simulations that do not require neonatal participants. The proposed method uses an extensive neonatal EEG database to simulate analogue signals, which are subsequently passed through electrical models of the skin-electrode interface, which are developed using wet and dry EEG electrode designs. The signal losses in the system are quantified at each stage of the acquisition process for electrode and acquisition board losses. SNR, correlation and noise values were calculated. The results verify that low-cost EEG acquisition systems are capable of obtaining clinical grade EEG. Although dry electrodes result in a significant increase in the skin-electrode impedance, accurate EEG recordings are still achievable.},

@article{Bertram1997,
abstract = {In recent years several new rat models of human limbic/mesial temporal lobe epilepsy have been described [1,2,4-7,11,15-17]. Unlike earlier models such as kindling in which the seizures are induced by an exogenous stimulus, these new models are characterized by seizures that occur spontaneously at random intervals. Although the spontaneity of the seizures makes these models more like human epilepsy, documentation of these seizures by direct observation is highly inefficient, and subbehavioral electrographic seizures could be missed. Continuous paper EEG and video recording have been used [5- 7,15], but these techniques are resource intensive. The slow paper speed required by long-term paper recordings limits the ability to differentiate between true seizure activity and electrical artifact. Subtle behavioral seizures are likely to be missed during rapid review of video recordings alone [16]. Ambulatory cassette EEG recordings have been used [3], but the systems require expensive proprietary hardware, and the systems have limited channels for recording (8-16). To improve the utility of the models, we developed a long-term EEG/video monitoring system to detect the electrographic seizures and document their behavioral accompaniment. The system is based on commercially available components, including a computerized EEG seizure detection system that was initially developed for human seizure monitoring [8,9,13]. Seizures are reliably detected and the data are reduced so that 24 h of recording can be reviewed in 30-90 min. Although the computer program is accurate, special care must be taken in system design and construction to reduce sources of electrical artifact that can cause false detections when multiple animals are recorded simultaneously on a single EEG machine. During data review it is necessary to differentiate between electrical artifact induced by animal activity from true seizure activity by key EEG patterns. Certain seizure patterns (less than 3 Hz, low amplitude) will not be detected by the seizure detection program, but the system is highly effective for typical limbic seizures and may be useful for the animal models of absence epilepsy [12,14]. It can also be used as a continuous or intermittent EEG//physiological recording device for experiments that examine animals' spontaneous behavior and the EEG correlate (e.g. sleep/wake cycles, learning and memory tasks).},

abstract = {This report focuses on active low-pass filter design using operational amplifiers. Low-pass filters are commonly used to implement antialias filters in data-acquisition systems. Design of second-order filters is the main topic of consideration. Filter tables are developed to simplify circuit design based on the idea of cascading lower-order stages to realize higher-order filters. The tables contain scaling factors for the corner frequency and the required Q of each of the stages for the particular filter being designed. This enables the designer to go straight to the calculations of the circuit-component values required. To illustrate an actual circuit implementation, six circuits, separated into three types of filters (Bessel, Butterworth, and Chebyshev) and two filter configurations (Sallen-Key and MFB), are built using a TLV2772 operational amplifier. Lab test data presented shows their performance. Limiting factors in the high-frequency performance of the filters are also examined.},

This work provides a design for a BCI to control a humanoid robot by using signals obtained from the Emotiv EPOC [11], a portable electroencephalogram (EEG) device with 14 electrodes and sampling rate of 128 Hz. The main objective is to process the neuroelectric responses to an externally driven stimulus and generate control signals for the humanoid robot Nao accordingly. We analyze steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) induced by one of four groups of light emitting diodes (LED) by using two distinct signals obtained from the two channels of the EEG device which reside on top of the occipital lobe. An embedded system is designed for generating pulse width modulated square wave signals in order to flicker each group of LEDs with different frequencies. The subject chooses the direction by looking at one of these groups of LEDs that represent four directions. Fast Fourier Transform and a Gaussian model are used to detect the dominant frequency component by utilizing harmonics and neighbor frequencies. Then, a control signal is sent to the robot in order to draw a fixed sized line in that selected direction by BCI. Experimental results display satisfactory performance where the correct target is detected 75{\%} of the time on the average across all test subjects without any training.},

To use the full potential of Jatropha and to support further expansion and systematic selection, breeding and domestication are a prerequisite. This review reveals and identifies gaps in knowledge that still impede domestication of Jatropha. Prebreeding knowledge is limited. In particular, the regeneration ecology and the degree of genetic diversity among and within natural populations in and outside the center of origin are poorly studied. There is only a limited understanding of the Jatropha breeding system and the effect of inbreeding and outbreeding. This review presents all currently available and relevant information on the species distribution, site requirements, regeneration ecology, genetic diversity, advances in selection, development of varieties and hybridization.

abstract = {This EEG Guideline incorporates the practice of structuring a report of results obtained during routine adult electroencephalography. It is intended to reflect one of the current practices in reporting an EEG and serves as a revision of the previous guideline entitled "Writing an EEG Report." The goal of this guideline is not only to convey clinically relevant information, but also to improve interrater reliability for clinical and research use by standardizing the format of EEG reports. With this in mind, there is expanded documentation of the patient history to include more relevant clinical information that can affect the EEG recording and interpretation. Recommendations for the technical conditions of the recording are also enhanced to include post hoc review parameters and type of EEG recording. Sleep feature documentation is also expanded upon. More descriptive terms are included for background features and interictal discharges that are concordant with efforts to standardize terminology. In the clinical correlation section, examples of common clinical scenarios are now provided that encourages uniformity in reporting. Including digital samples of abnormal waveforms is now readily available with current EEG recording systems and may be beneficial in augmenting reports when controversial waveforms or important features are encountered.},

abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) is a procedure that records brain activity in a non-invasive manner. The cost and size of EEG devices has decreased in recent years, facilitating a growing interest in wearable EEG that can be used out-of-the-lab for a wide range of applications, from epilepsy diagnosis, to stroke rehabilitation, to Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). A major obstacle for these emerging applications is the wet electrodes, which are used as part of the EEG setup. These electrodes are attached to the human scalp using a conductive gel, which can be uncomfortable to the subject, causes skin irritation, and some gels have poor long-term stability. A solution to this problem is to use dry electrodes, which do not require conductive gel, but tend to have a higher noise floor. This paper presents a novel methodology for the design and manufacture of such dry electrodes. We manufacture the electrodes using low cost desktop 3D printers and off-the-shelf components for the first time. This allows quick and inexpensive electrode manufacturing and opens the possibility of creating electrodes that are customized for each individual user. Our 3D printed electrodes are compared against standard wet electrodes, and the performance of the proposed electrodes is suitable for BCI applications, despite the presence of additional noise.},

An application example is given in the form of a multichannel EEG amplifier (gain is 20000), in which each channel consists of three operational amplifiers (one single and one dual), six resistors and two capacitors. The equivalent input noise voltage and current are 0.15 $\mu$Vrms and 1 pArms, respectively, in a bandwidth of 0.2-40 Hz, and a common mode rejection ratio of 136 dB is achieved without trimming. {\textcopyright} 1994 IFMBE.},

abstract = {This study integrates the hardware circuit design and the development support of the software interface to achieve a 32-channel EEG system for BCI applications. Since the EEG signals of human bodies are generally very weak, in addition to preventing noise interference, it also requires avoiding the waveform distortion as well as waveform offset and so on; therefore, the design of a preamplifier with high common-mode rejection ratio and high signal-to-noise ratio is very important. Moreover, the friction between the electrode pads and the skin as well as the design of dual power supply will generate DC bias which affects the measurement signals. For this reason, this study specially designs an improved single-power AC-coupled circuit, which effectively reduces the DC bias and improves the error caused by the effects of part errors. At the same time, the digital way is applied to design the adjustable amplification and filter function, which can design for different EEG frequency bands. For the analog circuit, a frequency band will be taken out through the filtering circuit and then the digital filtering design will be used to adjust the extracted frequency band for the target frequency band, combining with MATLAB to design man-machine interface for displaying brain wave. Finally the measured signals are compared to the traditional 32-channel EEG signals. In addition to meeting the IFCN standards, the system design also conducted measurement verification in the standard EEG isolation room in order to demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of this system design.},

abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) is an effective tool to non-invasively capture brain responses. Traditional EEG analogue front end (AFE) requires a driven right leg (DRL) circuit that restricts the number of channels of the device. The authors are proposing a new ‘DRL-less' AFE design, and have developed a wearable EEG device (NeuroMonitor), which is small, low-power, wireless, and battery operated. The EEG device with two independent channels was fabricated on an 11.35 cm2 PCB that contained a system-on-a-chip microcontroller, a low-noise instrument amplifier, a low-power Bluetooth module, a microSD, a microUSB, and a LiPo battery. The DRL circuit was eliminated by utilising the high CMRR instrument amplifier with differential inputs, and followed by a modified high-Q active Twin-T notch filter ((fc Notch = 60 Hz, − 38 dB). The signal was conditioned with a band-pass filter composed of a two-stage 2nd-order Chebyshev-I Sallen-Key low-pass filter cascaded with a passive 2nd-order low-pass filter (fc LP = 125 Hz) and a 1st-order passive high-pass filter (fc HP = 0.5 Hz). Finally, the signal was amplified to achieve an overall gain of 55.84 dB, and digitised with a 16-bit delta-sigma ADC (256 sps). The prototype weighs 41.8 gm, and has been validated against a research-grade EEG system (Neuroscan).},

abstract = {Dry electrodes are becoming popular for both lab-based and consumer-level electrophysiological-recording technologies because they better afford the ability to move traditional lab-based research into the real world. It is unclear, however, how dry electrodes compare in data quality to traditional electrodes. The current study compared three EEG electrode types: (a) passive-wet electrodes with no onboard amplification, (b) actively amplified, wet electrodes with moderate impedance levels, and low impedance levels, and (c) active-dry electrodes with very high impedance. Participants completed a classic P3 auditory oddball task to elicit characteristic EEG signatures and event-related potentials (ERPs). Across the three electrode types, we compared single-trial noise, average ERPs, scalp topographies, ERP noise, and ERP statistical power as a function of number of trials. We extended past work showing active electrodes' insensitivity to moderate levels of interelectrode impedance when compared to passive electrodes in the same amplifier. Importantly, the new dry electrode system could reliably measure EEG spectra and ERP components comparable to traditional electrode types. As expected, however, dry active electrodes with very high interelectrode impedance exhibited marked increases in single-trial and average noise levels, which decreased statistical power, requiring more trials to detect significant effects. This power decrease must be considered as a trade-off with the ease of application and long-term use. The current results help set constraints on experimental design with novel dry electrodes, and provide important evidence needed to measure brain activity in novel settings and situations. {\textcopyright} 2016 Society for Psychophysiological Research},

The device has a small form factor, so it is wearable, and has continuous Bluetooth connectivity. Tests were performed to assess features of the proposed device and to compare it with standard clinical devices. Simultaneous EEG recordings were measured from adjacent sites on the scalp using the new EEG device with dry electrodes and a reference EEG device with standard electrodes. The gain and bandwidth settings for the two devices were set similarly. Traditional closing eyes alpha-wave replacement and mu-rhythm were compared in both the time and frequency domains. Results from eight subjects show a high correlation coefficient (0.83 on average) between recordings of contiguous dry and standard electrodes. We conclude that the performance of the new device is comparable with standard EEG recording equipment, but offers a shorter set-up time, the possibility of long-term recording, and a wireless connection - all of which are advantages valuable in the field of brain computer interfaces and neurofeedback.},

The newly-developed sensor materials achieved significant improvement in EEG measurements while maintaining the advantages of previous silicone-based electrodes, including flexibility and non-toxicity. The experimental results indicated that the proposed electrodes maintained suitable performance even after exposure to temperature fluctuations, 85{\%} relative humidity, and enhanced corrosion conditions demonstrating improvements in the environmental stability. Fabricated flat (forehead) and acicular (hairy sites) electrodes composed of the optimum identified formulation exhibited low impedance and reliable EEG measurement; some initial human experiments demonstrate the feasibility of using these silicone-based electrodes for typical lab data collection applications.},

@article{Akwei-Sekyere2015,
abstract = {The distortion of biomedical signals by powerline noise from recording biomedical devices has the potential to reduce the quality and convolute the interpretations of the data. Usually, powerline noise in biomedical recordings are extinguished via band-stop filters. However, due to the instability of biomedical signals, the distribution of signals filtered out may not be centered at 50/60 Hz. As a result, self-correction methods are needed to optimize the performance of these filters. Since powerline noise is additive in nature, it is intuitive to model powerline noise in a raw recording and subtract it from the raw data in order to obtain a relatively clean signal. This paper proposes a method that utilizes this approach by decomposing the recorded signal and extracting powerline noise via blind source separation and wavelet analysis. The performance of this algorithm was compared with that of a 4th order band-stop Butterworth filter, empirical mode decomposition, independent component analysis and, a combination of empirical mode decomposition with independent component analysis. The proposed method was able to expel sinusoidal signals within powerline noise frequency range with higher fidelity in comparison with the mentioned techniques, especially at low signal-to-noise ratio.},

@misc{Lopez-Gordo2014,
abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) emerged in the second decade of the 20th century as a technique for recording the neurophysiological response. Since then, there has been little variation in the physical principles that sustain the signal acquisition probes, otherwise called electrodes. Currently, new advances in technology have brought new unexpected fields of applications apart from the clinical, for which new aspects such as usability and gel-free operation are first order priorities. Thanks to new advances in materials and integrated electronic systems technologies, a new generation of dry electrodes has been developed to fulfill the need. In this manuscript, we review current approaches to develop dry EEG electrodes for clinical and other applications, including information about measurement methods and evaluation reports. We conclude that, although a broad and non-homogeneous diversity of approaches has been evaluated without a consensus in procedures and methodology, their performances are not far from those obtained with wet electrodes, which are considered the gold standard, thus enabling the former to be a useful tool in a variety of novel applications.},

abstract = {This EEG Guideline incorporates the practice of structuring a report of results obtained during routine adult electroencephalography. It is intended to reflect one of the current practices in reporting an EEG and serves as a revision of the previous guideline entitled "Writing an EEG Report." The goal of this guideline is not only to convey clinically relevant information, but also to improve interrater reliability for clinical and research use by standardizing the format of EEG reports. With this in mind, there is expanded documentation of the patient history to include more relevant clinical information that can affect the EEG recording and interpretation. Recommendations for the technical conditions of the recording are also enhanced to include post hoc review parameters and type of EEG recording. Sleep feature documentation is also expanded upon. More descriptive terms are included for background features and interictal discharges that are concordant with efforts to standardize terminology. In the clinical correlation section, examples of common clinical scenarios are now provided that encourages uniformity in reporting. Including digital samples of abnormal waveforms is now readily available with current EEG recording systems and may be beneficial in augmenting reports when controversial waveforms or important features are encountered.},
